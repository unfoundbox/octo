# what does a well crafted life mean to you?

# have you ever found yourself at crossroads?

> situations where a socially conditioned part of you wants to do what will make you fit in well in society and won't make people raise their eyebrows.

> and another part, the authentic you, wants to dig deeper into the truth, your truth, and do what seems meaningful to you

that was the germ of the idea and led to the naamkaran of my life project

# **unfoundbox**

*eh so what, it's just a made up name, does it even mean anything?*

thinking outside the box is a phrase that's thrown around a lot.

the 3 dimensions surround you and the people in it make you feel that is all there is to think

till you go within, internalize what ideas, desires make you feel alive, give you meaning, and the courage to not live someone else's life
